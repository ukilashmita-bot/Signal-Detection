# Signal-Detection
A PsychoPy-based experiment measuring an individual’s ability to detect signals in noise, analyzing sensitivity (d’) and response bias (c) from 100 trials.
# Signal Detection Experiment

This repository contains a PsychoPy-based Signal Detection Theory experiment designed to assess an individual's ability to detect a visual signal in noise. It records the participant's responses over 100 trials and analyzes key metrics such as sensitivity (d’) and response bias (criterion c).

# Included Files

- `experiment.psyexp` – PsychoPy experiment file  
- `conditions_file.xlsx` – Conditions file specifying different stimulus tilts  
- `participant_data.csv` – Example data file for one participant  
- `analysis.xlsx` – Excel file calculating hits, misses, false alarms, correct rejections, d’, and c  
- `report.pdf` – Detailed lab report

# How to Run

1. Open the experiment file in PsychoPy.  
2. Ensure the `conditions_file.xlsx` is correctly linked in the experiment flow.  
3. Run the experiment and save participant data as a `.csv` file.

# Purpose

The experiment helps quantify an individual's ability to discriminate signal from noise, providing insight into sensory processing and decision-making strategies.
